# Zoho Interview ‚Äì Round 2 & Round 3 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions and implementations from the **Zoho interview process**.
It is divided into two parts:

* **Round 2 (DSA ‚Äì Problem Solving)**
* **Round 3 (LLD ‚Äì Low Level Design)**

---

## üìå Round 2 ‚Äì DSA Problems

This round focused on **Data Structures & Algorithms**, covering **easy to medium-level coding challenges**.
I have solved **5 problems** that test core problem-solving and logical thinking.

### Topics Covered

* Arrays & Strings
* Searching & Sorting
* Hashing
* Recursion / Backtracking
* Stack & Queue usage

You can find the code for each problem inside the `round-2/` folder.
Each file contains:

* Problem statement (as comments at the top)
* Code implementation
* Sample test cases

---

## üìå Round 3 ‚Äì Low Level Design (LLD)

This round was **design-oriented**, focusing on how to structure systems and write clean, modular code.

### Concepts Used

* **OOP principles** (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, Polymorphism)
* **SOLID principles**
* Class diagrams (where applicable)
* Clean & maintainable code design

The solutions are placed inside the `round-3/` folder.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd <repo-name>
   ```
3. Run the programs:

   * For Java:

     ```bash
     javac FileName.java
     java FileName
     ```

## üìñ Notes

* These solutions are based on **my personal preparation** and may differ from official Zoho problems.
* The focus was on **clarity, correctness, and efficiency**.

---

## üöÄ Future Work

* Adding more optimized versions for some DSA problems.
* Including UML diagrams for LLD problems.
* Extending with **system design** notes for higher rounds.

## ‚≠ê Acknowledgement

Special thanks to **Zoho interviewers** for designing interesting problem sets that encourage deep thinking in both **DSA** and **LLD**.
